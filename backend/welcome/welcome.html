            <p style="color: #6e6e6e; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 1.25rem; text-align: center;">Thank you for trying Smart Brain. I hope you have a great time using the app. This is a portfolio project that I am really excited about. I plan to continue updating this app over time, so be on the lookout for new features. Please note that I don't plan on sending any further emails at this time. However, if I decide to send email updates at a later date, you will receive a follow up email if you are still a registered user of Smart Brain. Thank you again and I hope you have a great day :)!</p>
